    "- You can combine one or more modalities depending on your experiment. \n",
    "- You can perform hyperparameter optimization either in unimodal mode or by combining other modalities with clinical data. In our case, we conducted hyperparameter searches for the omic and WSI (Whole Slide Image) modalities in the presence of clinical data. Once the optimal hyperparameters are identified, they can be fixed and used to train the full multimodal model. This ensures that the final model benefits from a well-optimized configuration that generalizes across modalities.\n",
    "- time_event must always be specified and should match the cohort (e.g., brca_time_event or lgg_time_event).\n",
    "- If using competing risks models, make sure to select *_clinical_cr and *_time_event_cr datasets.\n",
    "- For the WSI modality, we used the patch-based representation to enable experiments with multiple image instances per patient, which better captures intra-patient variability. Other image formats, such as CLAM masks and heatmaps, were used in intermediate tests but were not the primary focus of our experiments."
